In JavaScript, declaring variables serves several purposes:

1. Memory allocation: Reserves space in memory for storing values.
2. Identifier association: Associates a name (identifier) with the allocated memory.
3. Data typing: Implicitly sets the data type based on assigned value.
4. Scope definition: Defines variable accessibility within a specific scope.

To declare variables using the let keyword:


let variableName = initialValue;


Example:

let name = 'John Doe';
let age = 30;


let declarations:

1. Have block scope (limited to nearest {}).
2. Can be reassigned (name = 'Jane Doe';).
3. Cannot be redeclared (let name = 'Jane Doe'; throws error).

Best practices:

1. Use meaningful variable names.
2. Initialize variables with relevant values.
3. Use let for mutable variables.
4. Use const for immutable variables.


const PI = 3.14; // immutable
let counter = 0; // mutable
