In JavaScript, the five primitive data types are:

1. Number: Represents numeric values, either integers or floating-point numbers.

Example: let x = 10;

1. String: Represents text values, enclosed in quotes (single or double).

Example: let name = 'John Doe';

1. Boolean: Represents true or false values.

Example: let isAdmin = true;

1. Null: Represents the absence of any object value.

Example: let empty = null;

1. Undefined: Represents an uninitialized or non-existent variable.

Example: let uninitialized; console.log(uninitialized); // outputs: undefined

These primitive types are immutable and form the foundation of JavaScript's data model. All other data types, like arrays, objects, and functions, are built upon these primitives.
